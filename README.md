# Idea title

A crowdfunding platform for startup and business

# Problem Statement

Startup with basic idea struggle to raise fund because they can only receive money from local due to infrastructural issues.

## Supporting Staticstics

• According to the Humane Society of the United States, approximately 6-8 million dogs and cats enter animal shelters each year in the US alone.
• A study by the ASPCA estimated that about 1.5 million shelter animals are euthanized each year in the US.
• A survey by Statista found that in 2020, Americans spent $103.6 billion on their pets.

• The global real estate market was valued at $3.7 trillion in 2020, according to a report by Savills.
• The use of blockchain technology for real estate transactions is expected to grow significantly in the coming years, with a projected market size of $1.4 billion by 2026, according to a report by MarketsandMarkets.
• Tokenization of assets is a growing trend in the financial industry, with an estimated $6 trillion of assets expected to be tokenized by 2025, according to a report by PwC.

## Solution

The proposed solution is a crowdfunding platform for animal shelters where shelters act as individual creators and their content is cute animal photos. This platform can be used to raise funds for animal shelters from both locals and external donors. The platform would be powered by a stablecoin infrastructure like Circle, which would allow for fast and secure transactions.

A platform that enables tokenization of individual property ownership, allowing multiple investors to own a stake in the property and receive rental proceeds through Circle's infrastructure.

A community-funded learning program that focuses on developing a certain number of talents within a community or village, such as agriculture, renewable energy, or supply chain management. The program would allow for crowd funding, both locally and externally, to fund the training needs of the community, including trainers and equipment. Repayment could be made via contractors who work closely with the village, and the program could be managed through crowdfunding DAOs with a community-managed treasury and issuances.

## How to leverage Circle

Circle's technology could be leveraged to provide a secure and fast transactional expereience for users.

## Description

The proposed solution is a crowdfunding platform that enables animal shelters to raise funds through the creation of cute animal photo content. Here are some further details on how the platform would work:
• Content creation: Animal shelters would create cute animal photo content, which would be uploaded to the PetFunds platform for people to view.
• Crowdfunding: Individuals and external donors can donate to the animal shelter of their choice through the PetFunds platform. The platform would be powered by a stablecoin infrastructure like Circle, which would allow for fast and secure transactions.
• User engagement: Users can engage with the content and donate to their favorite animal shelters, with the option to receive updates on how the donations are being used.
• Donor reputation: The platform would provide donor reputation certificates to recognize donors who contribute to multiple animal shelters.
• Multi-purpose use: The solution could be used by animal shelters to raise funds for various purposes, such as medical expenses, food, and shelter maintenance.
By providing a crowdfunding platform for animal shelters, PetFunds could help raise funds for animal shelters in need, potentially reducing the number of animals euthanized each year. The use of Circle's technology could also provide a secure and fast transactional experience for users, ensuring that funds are delivered directly to the animal shelters.

The proposed solution is a community-funded learning program that focuses on developing specific talents within a community or village, such as agriculture, renewable energy, or supply chain management. Here are some further details on how the program would work:
• Learning agenda: The program would create a learning agenda that focuses on developing a certain number of talents within the community or village. The learning agenda would be developed in consultation with community members to ensure that it meets the needs of the community.
• Crowd funding: The program would allow for crowd funding, both locally and externally, to fund the training needs of the community, including trainers and equipment. This could be done through crowdfunding DAOs with a community-managed treasury and issuances.
• Repayment: Repayment could be made via contractors who work closely with the village, providing a sustainable way for the community to repay the funding provided for the program.
• Trainers and equipment: The program would provide trainers and equipment to the community to ensure that they have the necessary tools and knowledge to develop the specific talents identified in the learning agenda.
• Secure and transparent transactions: Circle's technology could be leveraged to facilitate secure and transparent transactions for the program, including payments to trainers and equipment suppliers.
By providing a community-funded learning program that focuses on developing specific talents within a community or village, the proposed solution could help address the lack of access to training programs that many communities face. The use of crowd funding and community-managed treasury could also provide a sustainable way for the program to be funded and managed over the long-term, while the use of Circle's technology could ensure secure and transparent transactions for the program.

The proposed solution is a platform that enables tokenization of individual property ownership, allowing multiple investors to own a stake in the property and receive rental proceeds. Here are some further details on how the platform would work:
• Tokenization of ownership: The platform would enable individual property ownership to be tokenized, creating fractional ownership for multiple investors.
• Rental proceeds distribution: Rental proceeds from the property would be distributed to the token holders through Circle's infrastructure, ensuring secure and efficient transfer of funds.
• Fees payment: Fees associated with the ownership and management of the property, such as property management fees or legal fees, could also be paid through Circle's infrastructure.
• Transparent ledger: The platform would maintain a transparent ledger of all transactions and ownership stakes, ensuring transparency and accountability among investors.
• Compliance: The platform would comply with relevant regulations and laws, such as real estate laws and securities laws, ensuring that investors are protected.
By providing a platform that enables tokenization of individual property ownership, the proposed solution could help increase access to real estate investments and enable fractional ownership. The use of Circle's infrastructure for the distribution of rental proceeds and payment of fees could also provide a secure and efficient way for investors to manage their real estate investments.
